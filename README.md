# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System-Using-Arduino
Our solution uses an Arduino board with OpenCV and dlib for real-time drowsiness detection. It analyzes facial expressions and eye movements to alert drivers through visual and auditory signals, preventing accidents from drowsy driving.

The hardware components, including the Arduino board, LCD, buzzer, and LED will be used to create a user-friendly interface for drivers. The system will provide immediate alerts to the driver through visual and auditory signals if drowsiness is detected, helping to prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving.
